        "View All Employees",
        "Add a Department",
        "Add a Role",
        "Update an Employee Role",
        "View Employees by Manager",
        "View Employees by Role",
        "Add an Employee"
All of these questions are related to functions that run upon selection and update the database containing the information that the questions pertain to.
